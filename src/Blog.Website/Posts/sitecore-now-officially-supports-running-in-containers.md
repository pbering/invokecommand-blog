While we have been running [Sitecore in containers in production for a while](/posts/sitecore-on-docker-swarm-in-production) it has never been explicit and officially approved by Sitecore to do so... *until now*!

Check out [https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/161310](https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/161310) for the details.

In my opinion it's a very important step for Sitecore as a platform, us and our customers and I for one is *extremely happy* :)

A special thank you to everyone involved in making this happen!
